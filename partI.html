                Following their legendary heist, Michael, Trevor, and Franklin went on to live divergent lives. Michael
                went onto to become a well-known filmmaker while his children’s lives deteriorated into drug-induced
                hazes. Franklin impregnated a woman who would give birth to his only son, Walker, whom he hardly saw
                before his death by overdosing. Trevor married Patricia, Martin Madrazo’s former wife, who ended his
                streak of cocaine-fueled rampages and convinced him to give a large portion of his earnings to charity
                and work in law-enforcement to ensure that he’d stay out of trouble. They adopted Walker at the age of
                six, as Michael wanted nothing to do with him and Franklin had to family to speak of. Trevor and Walker
                became very close, which helped Trevor to get through his wife’s death a few years later. The Blood
                Plague, a virus that converted living humans to zombies and zombies to mutants, first broke out in
                Liberty City when Walker was 16. Despite the military’s best efforts to contain it, the virus soon broke
                quarantine and encompassed the entire state. Michael and Trevor had already been preparing for such an
                event for years and was able to transport Walker close to their safehouse before being killed by a Feral
                soon after Michael. Walker avenged his father by defeating the Feral alone, but in the process, was
                infected with the Plague.
                <br>
                <br>
                After a few months, Walker found himself running low on medical supplies to suppress his plague and
                ventured out of his safehouse to scavenge. He encountered a group of survivors, among whom was Garcia, a
                nurse who’d found a cure to the Plague, which she administered to Walker. He brought the group back to
                the safehouse and shared his supplies with them, quickly gaining their trust and support. They soon
                elected him as their leader and under his direction began to gather allies from the surrounding
                communities. His group soon became large, with multiple outposts and trading routes providing safe
                passage throughout the entire region. Walker followed in his police-officer father’s footsteps, seeing
                himself as a sheriff and instilling a firm order wherever he went.
                <br>
                Despite their best efforts to wipe-out the plague through medicine, Blood Plague was still a threat. The
                community was left with no choice but to order a strike against an infestation of plague-zombies
                guarding what Garcia referred to as a Plague Heart, a visceral nest of plague-carrying zombies
                surrounded by a sickening red mist. He and Garcia, who had grown rather close to, successfully led the
                strike-team to plant explosives on the Heart, but not before Garcia was ripped apart by a horde of
                infected Ferals after detonating the charge. Such a deep and binding trauma filled Walker at the sight
                of her living-body being torn apart that he could not move. From the gory vascular remains of the Heart
                stepped a tall woman surrounded by a blinding red light. Her eyes shone a radiant red and her skin
                appeared as the white of a blizzard-sky; long white hair trailed behind her, touching but not absorbing
                the well of blood at her feet. The beasts surrounding her fell to the ground in supplication, completely
                ignoring Walker as he turned and fled back to the safehouse all the while feeling the creature’s eyes
                blazing upon him.
                <br>
                <br>
                Once home, Walker was inconsolable and was a leader in name only. Every night he had nightmares of
                Garcia’s death and the tall woman in the Heart. He could hear her, sometimes even in broad daylight,
                calling out to him and demanding more blood. Some months later, a new survivor, a nurse like Garcia,
                named Vargas joined the community’s ranks and soon became attached to Walker. He would sometimes call
                her Garcia, as the two looked very much alike. Vargas suggested that they both go on a trip to a nearby
                struggling community to help them find medical supplies. Walker obliged, and soon they were far away
                from home and traveling with newfound friends. After they had secured several weeks’ worth of supplies,
                the group leader asked the two if they’d be willing to help destroy a Plague Heart that was causing them
                numerous casualties. Walker obliged but ordered Vargas to stay behind. After destroying the Heart, the
                tall woman once more rose from its remains, this time emitting a terrible shriek summoned numerous
                hordes from the surrounding hills, leaving Walker the last standing. The woman raised her arm, and as
                she did the hordes collapsed in unison. She approached Walker, who felt an intense calm in her presence
                and extended her hand, touching him lightly on his forehead and filling his mind with a vivid vision
                that he would never forget.
                <br>
                <br>
                In his dream, he saw himself knelt before a beating Plague Heart in supplication, a bloodied heart in
                his hands and a dozen more surrounding him. He offered the hearts up to the Heart and a skinless arm
                emerged from its fleshy surface to take his each of his offerings. It quickly retracted as the Heart
                began to beat rapidly; a mass had formed in its center in the shape of a skeleton. Pink muscle grew
                around the bones and dark flesh the muscle. A shock of realization filled Walker as he recognized the
                form before him as Garcia. As soon as her eyes opened Walker found himself awake and in the infirmary of
                his new friends’ community.
                <br>
                <br>
                His aim was now clear; to bring the Plague Heart what she desired. Using his charisma and combat skills,
                Walker successfully lured and subsequently killed nearly half of the community’s members and
                ritualistically removed their hearts, preserving them in a cooler he carried at all times. He mourned
                with the community, who went onto name the surrounding roads after their dead comrades. Walker and
                Garcia eventually headed back home to establish a new base of operations as Walker felt their own
                community had outgrown its current confines. As they were clearing out a nearby warehouse to use a new
                base, Walker nearly let Vargas succumb to a horde of plague-zombies, his mind already feeling the joy he
                would when Garcia would be returned to life. He soon after began the construction of a field hospital,
                something that would be vital in gaining the additional hearts he would need for the Plague Heart. Once
                it was completed with Vargas’ help, Walker injected several sleeping members of the community with
                plague samples, causing them to catch the Plague and be moved into the hospital’s beds. From there, he
                would remove their hearts in their sleep and burry the bodies in secret to not arouse suspension. As he
                was removing the last heart, Vargas walked in on him to check on a patient. Walker shot in the shoulder
                with his revolver, not having the strength to kill her, before fleeing the settlement and fatally
                shooting several guards. He had no idea where he was running, but felt the woman’s call in his mind and
                followed his instincts until he arrived at a run-down shack surrounded by docile Ferals- seemingly
                awaiting his arrival. He stepped into its dark confines guided only by the faintly glowing mist. The
                Plague Heart beat with a deranged excitement at his approach; he knelt before it and offered up to its
                extended arms each heart as he had in its vision. With the final heart offered up, Walker raised his
                eyes to its center and watched as Garcia’s body rapidly formed in a vivid and meticulous flash of flesh
                and muscle. At last, her eyes opened to reveal glowing red orbs that burned with the intensity of the
                Heart’s beat. Walker remained kneeling, even as the shade of Garcia bared its fangs in a ferocious
                snarl, his heart blinded to his love for her past self. Walker remained kneeling, even as she sunk her
                fangs into his neck, draining the life from his still body in a matter of seconds.
                <br>
                <br>
                Vargas stood transfixed in the doorway, having witnessed the man she had once loved die before her eyes.
                She raised her own weapon, aiming at the creature’s head still bent over Walker’s neck before pulling
                the trigger. A roar sounded from the pulsating Plague Heart as the once docile horde surrounding the
                shack turned its rage on Vargas and tore her limb from limb as Garcia had been.
