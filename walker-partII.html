                Walker: Part Two
                In the months following Walker’s selfish sacrifice to the Plague Heart, the already hopeless communities
                that dotted the dead land were left with nothing while the Plagued Hordes grew in size and strength.
                Soon the countryside where Walker built his once admirable community was nothing more than a wasteland
                full of struggling scavengers with no future before them. A blackish-red skin-like film protruding with
                thick veins covered the earth for miles around the slowly beating Heart. Towers of flesh and bone loomed
                over the barren landscape, touching the sky and emitting blood-filled clouds of vapor that tinted the
                clouds a sickly pink color.
                <br>
                <br>
                At the edge of the bloodied land atop a high clifftop, the last remains of Walker’s settlement lay, now
                just a withering shack, inhabited by just three survivors who had evaded his slaughter. They were all
                young, being two men and a woman, on the brink of desperation and living on rations that left them
                faint. Plagued blood dripped steadily through the shattered roof of their shack, pooling into simmering
                puddles before evaporating in the scorching heat of the summer’s fading daylight. The youngest of the
                three, Becki, sat slumped against the wall, unable to move from a wrecking fatigue brought on by hours
                in sun’s rays with nothing but poorly filtered water to drink. Outside, she could see the men in the
                middle of piling the bodies of the plagued horde into a deep trench that was nearly overflowing with
                glistening red bodies covered in skin that rippled like water as it melted away in their final deaths.
                The red-tinted sun gave them just enough light to complete their morbid task before the bodies’ flesh
                began to melt into a mucous-like fluid that left their skeletons charred and disjointed before sinking
                further into the blood-filled trench’s depths.
                <br>
                <br>
                Wearily, the others entered the building and wiped their bloody hands on a matted towel before
                collapsing across the room from her, unable to stand any longer. They sat in silence for some time
                before, afraid that the slightest noise would draw another horde. Nothing but the distant moans of the
                flesh towers in the plagued lands beyond their settlement could be heard until Becki spoke in a soft
                fearful voice “Was that the last of them?” Her light-blue eyes darted around to each hole and crevice in
                the walls in dreadful anticipation. “I think so” sighed Joel, the oldest of the group, a muscular man in
                his mid-twenties, as he lay his hunting rifle against the wall. Joel had taken up the role of leader of
                their small group after Walker’s betrayal, having survived his slaughter at the infirmary on that night
                months ago. “I don’t think I can do this much longer” Becki said as she gazed over her fresh wounds, her
                voice a mix of hopelessness and a deep sadness. “We’re staying here. There’s not a single settlement in
                miles that wouldn’t shoot us the second they find out where we came from. I just need more time and
                we’ll have a working radio to call for help from out of state.” Joel replied sternly. “You think I don’t
                know that? Walker murdered my parents in front of me! We just need to go far away, I don’t care where, I
                just can’t live like this anymore, this is worse than being dead” Becki lowered her head, a tear running
                down her paled cheek. Andrew laid an arm on her shoulder comfortingly, trying his hardest to hide his
                own sorrow. “We’ll be gone soon. I swore I’d get us out of this place as soon as I could” Joel rose to
                his feet, steadying himself on weak legs. “Andrew, let’s get the grill going before it gets dark.”
                Andrew rose to his feet reluctantly, leaving Becki on her own as he exited the dwelling with Joel
                through a door barely hanging on its hinges. He peaked back through the door, “Don’t worry, this one’s…
                newer than the last one.” Becki’s sadness was soon overtaken with revulsion as a nauseating aroma akin
                to burning plastic and sulfur filled the room. Noxious fumes of pinkish hues seeped in through the holes
                in the walls for several minutes before dying out. The men stepped back into the room now carrying slabs
                of simmering reddish meat on a rusted baking sheet. If not for the stench and odd protrusions, the
                neatly cooked and cut meat would have seemed innocuous, if not appetizing. Andrew scooped the most
                inconspicuous slab off the tray onto a plate and carried it over to Becki, carefully placing in front of
                her. “We ran out of seasonings today” he said apologetically. “That’s fine” she lied, forcing a thin
                smile as she began to cut into the meat with a dull knife, careful not to look to closely at it as she
                brought a sizzling bite to her mouth. She winced with watering eyes as the sickly morsel touched her
                tongue, but nevertheless forced herself to chew and swallow the rancid meat. The three ate in silence,
                each forcing down the meal as a child does bitter medicine. Becki leaned against the wall, fighting back
                a wave of nausea after a particularly squishy bite had left her teeth filled with gristle. From beyond
                the wall she heard a sound that filled her with more dread that the demonic howls of the plagued hordes.
                Voices, muffled human voices. Whispers in the darkness poorly concealed. She instinctively raised a
                finger to her lips, using her other hand to gesture that they had hostile visitors. Joel’s face whitened
                as he slowly reached for his rifle and aimed it at the front door, his grip shaking with nervous
                anticipation. Andrew clutched his hatchet, a deep dread rising within him. Just then, the door burst
                inward as a group of four men in black masks armed with rifles barged into the shack, their weapons
                raised. Joel dropped his weapon, seeing that they were outnumbered, and put his hands in the air. “Drop
                your weapon, now!” one of the men commanded, aiming his rifle at Andrew, who dropped his hatchet in
                fear. “Please, we don’t have any supplies-“ Joel stammered. “We aren’t here for your stuff, though we’ll
                be taking whatever you have” he turned his focus Joel. “Search the building, take everything you find.
                You three come outside with me.” The three other men went to work overturning the shack as the they
                exited the building into the night. The sky above was a rich tapestry of stars made whole by a stunning
                yellow moon that shone a wealth of light to the desolate plain below. “On your knees” the main ordered,
                shoving Andrew to ground. He placed the barrel of his rifle to Joel’s head, his grip shaking with a
                palpable anger. “It took us months to track you scum down. Your leader killed my brothers, destroyed our
                community and brought this new Plague on us all. Never thought anyone would be stupid enough to live
                this close to the Plague Heart. But I guess the Heart spares it’s servants, doesn’t it?” “Please, we
                don’t have anything to do with Walker, he’s been dead for-“ the man collided his rifle with Joel’s head,
                sending him falling backward into the dead grass, a trickle of blood running down his temple. “Joel!”
                Becki shrieked, lunging over his side before the roar of a gunshot pierced the night and a pain unlike
                any she had ever felt shot up her arm. She screamed once more, falling onto her back and looking on with
                astonishment as Andrew leapt to his feet, charging into the man and knocking him to the ground. The
                rifle fell from the attacker’s hands as his tall form collided with the earth. “Run!” Andrew shouted,
                pushing his elbow into the man’s throat, just as the three other men burst from the shack, their weapons
                readied. Without hesitation, Becki leapt to her feet, adrenaline overriding the pain from her wound as
                she sprinted toward the away from the shack towards the cliff’s edge overlooking the plagued lands. More
                gunshots rang out golden bullets flew through the air, once more striking her, this time in her leg,
                causing her to tumble toward the ground and over the edge into the dark below.
